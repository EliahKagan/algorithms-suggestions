Future directions?

directed graph topological sort by iterative DFS, by BFS
undirected graph MSF by Prim's on each component, returning the MSF itself
repeated Dijkstra's algorithm, returning data structure providing all shortest paths
Morris traversal and related O(1) space dismantling of a tree (see note in Sutter)
iterative deepening depth-first search of trees and graphs
