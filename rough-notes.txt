Future directions?

self-balancing trees: AVL trees, red-black trees, and splay trees
order statistics on a self-balancing tree
directed graph topological sort by iterative DFS and by BFS
undirected graph MSF by Prim's algo on each component, returning the MSF itself
repeated Dijkstra's algorithm, returning data structure providing all shortest paths
Morris traversal and related O(1)-space dismantling of a tree (see note in Sutter)
iterative deepening depth-first search of trees and graphs
