# algorithms-suggestions - exercises and notes on algorithms

These are some ideas for exercises in learning algorithms and data structures
informally, such as in a self-directed way, by mentorship, or by collaboration
between learners, or some combination thereof. It also includes some notes and
illustrations, presenting some conceptual topics.

This is *far* from comprehensive coverage of important algorithms and data
structures topics. It is mostly limited to linked lists and binary trees.
