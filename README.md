# algorithms-suggestions - algorithms exercises and exposition

These are some ideas for exercises in learning algorithms and data structures
informally, such as in a self-directed way, by mentorship, or by collaboration
between learners, or some combination thereof. It also includes some notes and
illustrations, presenting some conceptual topics.

This is *far* from comprehensive coverage of important algorithms and data
structures topics. It is mostly limited to linked lists and binary trees.

## What's here?

The contents are:

- `algorithms-suggestions.md` is the main file, containing descriptions of a
  number of exercises.
- The `theory-notes*` files are about linked lists and call stacks.
- `rough-notes.md` and `graphs.md` suggest future directions for more
  exercises.

Implementations of the exercises are not included in this repository. They are
in separate repositories.

## Implementations

There are two partial implementations of these exercises:
[Pool](https://github.com/EliahKagan/Pool) and
[Search](https://github.com/EliahKagan/Search).

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [**David Vassallo**](https://github.com/dmvassallo) for extensive
consideration and feedback regarding this material, and for testing out
numerous suggested exercises, and for suggesting the exercise to pretty-print a
tree.

Although work is not currently continuing on algorithms-suggestions or its
implementations, the subsequent, more ambitious project
