Define and write tests tests for (warmup):
    a function that prints a vector, of anything printable, in a single line.
    a function that sorts a vector of int (can use std::sort).
    a function that sorts a vector of int, but puts all odds before all evens.

Define and write tests for:
    a class template providing an expanding (but not contracting) object pool.

Define and write tests for:
    a singly linked list node type.
    a function that constructs a singly linked list from a vector.
    a function that constructs a vector from a singly linked list.
    a function that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle.

Define and write tests for:
    a binary tree node type (with no back-pointers).
    a helper function to make trees like f(4, f(3, {}}, {}}), f(5, {}}, {}})).
    a function that constructs a vector from a binary tree, in any order.
    preorder, inorder, postorder, and level order traversal (and display).
    iterative preorder traversal.

Define and write tests for:
    a function that detects violations of the tree's topological invariant.
