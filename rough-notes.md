# Future directions?

- self-balancing trees: AVL trees, red-black trees, and splay trees
- order statistics on a self-balancing tree
- directed graph topological sort by iterative DFS and by BFS
- undirected graph MSF by Prim&rsquo;s algo on each component, returning the MSF itself
- repeated Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm, returning data structure providing all shortest paths
- Morris traversal and related *O(1)*-space dismantling of a tree (see note in Sutter)
- iterative deepening depth-first search of trees and graphs
